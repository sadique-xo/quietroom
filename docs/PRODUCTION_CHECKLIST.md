## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Create production environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_production_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_production_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key

# 2. Update Clerk production settings
- Add production domain to Clerk allowed URLs
- Switch to production Clerk instance
- Test authentication flow in production
```

### Step 2: Vercel Deployment
```bash
# 1. Connect repository to Vercel

  - Framework: Next.js
  - Build Command: next build
  - Output Directory: .next
  - Install Command: npm install

# 2. Add environment variables
- Add all production environment variables
- Verify Clerk and Supabase URLs are correct

# 3. Deploy
- Trigger deployment
- Monitor build process
- Verify deployment success
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification

## 🔍 Production Monitoring Setup

### Error Tracking (Recommended: Sentry)
```bash
# 1. Set up Sentry
npm install @sentry/nextjs

# 2. Configure in next.config.ts
const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/nextjs');

const nextConfig = {
  // ... existing config
};

module.exports = withSentryConfig(nextConfig, {
  // Sentry configuration
});
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# 1. Vercel Analytics (Built-in)
- Enable in Vercel dashboard
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track user engagement

# 2. Google Analytics (Optional)
- Add GA4 tracking code
- Monitor user behavior
- Track conversion goals
```

### Database Monitoring
```bash
# 1. Supabase Dashboard
- Monitor query performance
- Check storage usage
- Review error logs
- Monitor RLS policy effectiveness
```

## 🧪 Test Pages Removal

### Option 1: Remove Test Pages (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove these files before production:
- src/app/test-auth/page.tsx
- src/app/test-storage/page.tsx
```

### Option 2: Protect Test Pages
```bash
# Add authentication protection to test pages
# Only allow access to authenticated users
# Or restrict to development environment only
```
