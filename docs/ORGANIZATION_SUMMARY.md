# 📁 Documentation Organization Summary

## ✅ What Was Organized

### 📂 Created `docs/` Folder
- **Location:** `/docs/`
- **Purpose:** Centralized location for all project documentation
- **Benefits:** Cleaner root directory, better organization, easier navigation

### 📄 Files Moved to `docs/`
All `.md` files except `README.md` were moved from the root directory:

#### 🚀 Production & Deployment
- `PRODUCTION_SUMMARY.md` - Final production readiness summary
- `PRODUCTION_REVIEW.md` - Comprehensive production assessment
- `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - General deployment instructions

#### 🏗️ Development & Architecture
- `design-doc.md` - Application design documentation
- `summary.md` - Project summary and overview
- `tasks.md` - Development tasks and roadmap

#### 🔧 Technical Guides
- `STORAGE_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Supabase storage setup and troubleshooting
- `INTEGRATION_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Clerk-Supabase integration fixes
- `image-storage-brainstorm.md` - Image storage implementation planning

#### 🎨 User Experience
- `UX_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` - User experience improvement roadmap

### 📄 Files Remaining in Root
- `README.md` - Main project readme (stays in root for GitHub visibility)
- `env.example` - Environment variables template (stays in root for easy access)
