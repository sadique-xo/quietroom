## 📊 Steve Jobs Design Principles Applied

### Simplicity
- **Current Issue**: Information overload on home screen
- **Solution**: Progressive disclosure, single-focus screens
- **Implementation**: Hide secondary actions, emphasize primary CTA

### Focus
- **Current Issue**: Multiple competing elements
- **Solution**: Clear visual hierarchy, single primary action per screen
- **Implementation**: Hero content, supporting elements in visual background

### Intuitive Design
- **Current Issue**: Non-obvious interactions
- **Solution**: Familiar social media patterns, clear affordances
- **Implementation**: Standard gestures, recognizable icons

### Beautiful Details
- **Current Issue**: Generic animations and transitions
- **Solution**: Custom spring animations, delightful micro-interactions
- **Implementation**: Physics-based animations, haptic feedback
