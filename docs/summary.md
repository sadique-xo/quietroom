I have a Next.js journaling app with the following setup:

**TECH STACK:**
- Next.js 15.4.4 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Clerk authentication with custom JWT templates for Supabase
- Supabase PostgreSQL database + Storage
- File-only image uploads (no base64)

**CURRENT STATE:**
- ✅ Authentication working (Clerk user IDs stored as TEXT in database)
- ✅ Image uploads working (File objects → Supabase storage buckets)
- ✅ Images displaying properly (public buckets + RLS policies)
- ✅ RLS security implemented (users can only access their own data)
- ✅ Clean modern file handling with URL.createObjectURL()

**DATABASE SCHEMA:**
- `entries` table with: id, user_id (TEXT), date, photo_url, photo_filename, photo_size, photo_format, caption, timestamp
- RLS policies ensuring user data isolation
- `clerk_user_id()` function extracting user ID from JWT

**STORAGE SETUP:**
- Public buckets (`journal-entries`, `thumbnails`) for image display
- RLS policies on storage.objects for upload/delete security
- Folder structure: `user_id/filename` for organization

**KEY FILES:**
- `src/lib/supabase-storage.ts` - Database operations
- `src/lib/image-upload.ts` - File upload handling  
- `src/app/new/page.tsx` - Entry creation
- `src/lib/supabase-auth.ts` - Clerk + Supabase integration

**WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:**
[Specify your next goal - e.g., adding features, performance optimization, UI improvements, testing, deployment, etc.]

Please review the architecture and suggest improvements or help implement new features while maintaining the clean, secure foundation we've established.
